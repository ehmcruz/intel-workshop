Intel Modern Code is an initiative to spread knowledge on how to design and optimize software through the use of parallelism, aiming to exploit the full potential of computers and supercomputers.
This community is made up of experts who provide libraries, support and training in modern code techniques.
The GPPD (Parallel and Distributed Processing Group), the Institute of Informatics at UFRGS, joined the modern source community as an Intel Partner Modern Code (MCP) in August 2016 to offer courses and training.
